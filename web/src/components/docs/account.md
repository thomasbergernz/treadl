## Modify your account

Treadl purposefully does not collect much information from you, aside from the details required to log in (a username/email and password, which can both be changed via your account settings on the website, as shown above).

If you have entered additional profile information, and wish to change or remove this, then navigate to your profile page on the website, and click the "Edit profile" button. You will then be able to change or remove the different areas of your profile.
