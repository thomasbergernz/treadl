# Treadl Mobile

The source code for Treadl's iOS and Android application.

## Overview

The application is written in Dart using the Flutter framework.

The mobile app currently supports only a subset of the features of the web app, and is largely useful only for the groups functionality.

## Start

Before building, some housekeeping needs to be done first:

* The `key.properties` file needs to be created in `android/`. This should correctly reference the `key.jks` file
* The `android/app/google-services.json` needs to be created with the Firebase configuration

##Â Notes

* Undraw hex code used: #F34E83
